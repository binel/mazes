Bugs
- Resizing the window causes the grid to get messed up 
- Resizing cell size doesn't work very well 
- coloring for grids with many small cells looks bad 
- Fix the memory leaks 

Features 
- Implement Wilson's 
- Implement Hunt-and-kill 
- Implement Recursive backtracker 
- Implement a menu to choose between play modes 
- Implement start & end squares 
	- Set start & end squares using longest path detection 
- Holding down a key while in "play" mode should have the player move in consecutive moves 
- Implement a different way of rendering where walls are as big as passages
- Some kind of "stats" mode to generate a bunch of mazes and count stats? 
- Instead of having two different types of generation - instant and progress, 
	just have the progress type. Each frame tries to make as much progress as possible.
	Implement a configurable top cap on progress per frame so that you can slow down 
	the animation. This would make it so slow generation types like random walk don't 
	beachball on large mazes 


Tech Debt
- Linting? 
- Tests? 
- Split out player logic from grid logic 
- Fix bad memory use in dijkstra's
